# Simple-Employee-Payroll

This is a C program that calculates and displays the net pay of multiple employees.

The program uses an array of structures, where each element of the array represents an employee and contains information such as employee number, name, basic pay, allowances, deductions, and net pay. The program takes the number of employees as input and then takes the information for each employee and calculates their net pay (basic pay + allowances - deductions). Finally, it displays the information for all employees in a tabular format.
