# Simple Employee Payroll
This is a C program that simulates a simple employee payroll system. It is designed to help small business owners manage their employees' salary information, including their hourly wage, hours worked, and deductions for taxes and other expenses. The program calculates each employee's gross pay, net pay, and taxes owed based on the provided input.

The program consists of several classes, including Employee, Payroll, and Tax. The Employee class defines the attributes and methods associated with each employee, such as their name, hourly wage, hours worked, and deductions. The Payroll class manages the list of employees and their associated salary information, and provides methods for adding and removing employees, calculating payroll, and printing out employee salary information. The Tax class handles the calculation of taxes owed based on the employee's gross pay and tax rate.

To use the program, the user must first add employees to the payroll system. Once added, the program can calculate each employee's salary information and print out a summary of the payroll. The user can also view detailed salary information for each employee.

Overall, this program provides a simple and effective solution for managing employee payroll for small businesses.
